// loads the extension at ActorSystem creation time
// For extensions that we want to load at the ActorSystem creation time we should specify FQCNs
// (fully qualified class name) of implementations of ExtensionId
// Alternatively, we can define a class/object that implements ExtensionIdProvider and specify its FQCN instead.
akka.extensions = ["net.zhenglai.quest.akka.extensions.SettingsExtension"]

// A third party library may register its extension to be loaded at ActorSystem creation time.
// This is achieved by appending the extension's FQCN to akka.library-extensions in the reference.conf file
// akka.library-extensions += "com.example.extension.ExampleExtension"
